Please see readme to PraxNes program first as this is an upgrade to the original.

This program was meant to be an upgrade to the previous PraxNes program as I had gained more experience and wanted to be able to provide a GUI for the program.
The program also changed quite a bit because I was going to impliment the web view right into the program rather than open a page in a browser.  And there was a box
to make the entire note we have to make for our graduation review instead of just the beginning.  I never did finish this project as the student handbook articles that
we used were changed and this program would no longer work.  But it does show a great leap of quality from the original so I have included it in its incomplete form.
